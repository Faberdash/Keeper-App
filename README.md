# Keeper-App
A Web based note taking app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To use it:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal and cd to where it is saved
3. Type in "yarn start"

Note: The notes taken will not be saved upon closing the app, as no backend was implemented for it.
